#   Endless Runner Game
### This is a fun endless runner game made with Godot. The player can run, jump, and collect coins while avoiding obstacles. The path is endless and keeps generating new parts, so the game never stops. Coins and obstacles appear randomly, making each run different. Try to collect as many points as you can without hitting anything!
