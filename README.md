#   Endless Runner Game
This is a 3D endless runner game developed using the Godot engine, featuring a procedurally generated path filled with dynamic hurdles and collectible coins. I implemented procedural generation logic to continuously spawn obstacles and coins, ensuring varied gameplay with every run. The game increases in difficulty over time, with faster movement and more complex obstacle patterns. I handled all core systems including player controls, obstacle spawning, collision detection, and difficulty scaling. This project highlights my skills in 3D game development, procedural content generation, and gameplay balancing using GDScript.
